# MemoryWallet

Provide a reproducible offline brain wallet:
1. That can create and recreate wallets for Bitcoin and Monero from a remembered passphrase.
2. That can recreate wallets for Bitcoin AND Monero from a 24 word bitcoin seed.

This project started by merging https://xcubicle.github.io/memorypaperwallet/ and https://iancoleman.io/bip39/
